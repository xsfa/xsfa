### Hi there 👋
My name is Tesfa (he/him) and I am a senior studying computer science at University of Washington Bothell

## What I am doing right now 🛠️
Currently I am:
- Building Pongo! We are helping e-commerce stores leverage survey data to generate more sales through cross-selling and quanitiative social proof. **Learn more here --> https://joinpongo.com** 🦧
- Doing a **data engineering internship at Tesla** ⚡

## Why do I code 💫
There is a certain magic to applying technology to act on problems and inefficiencies that you see in your work, life, or out in the world.
